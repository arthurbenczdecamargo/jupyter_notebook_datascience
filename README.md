# Jupyter Notebook data science
**Data science using *Jupyter Notebook* and the *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* libraries.**

## Overview
This project utilizes *Jupyter Notebook* and *Anaconda* to analyze and interpret data and then create visualizations using *Matplotlib*. The program loads the data related to apple prices over the years in different cities and generates informative graphs. Additionally, it calculates the angular coefficient and the norm, giving more clarity on the data patterns.

## Features
• Transposes data to create graphs;<br>
• Analyzes apple price trends over the years;<br>
• Saves the angular coefficient and the norm in a CSV file.

## Notes
**This project was made through a course on the [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/) website.<br>
First contact with python data science.**
